Spring Cloud Stream Kafka and native encoding
==============================================

In this *Spring Cloud Stream* sample, we demonstrate native encoding with Kafka and functions.
Spring Cloud Stream will skip the regular message conversion and on the outbound and let Kafka natively perform serialization.

## Requirements

To run this sample, you will need to have installed:

* Java 8 or Above

## Code Tour

There is a test provided where we verify the native conversion done by Kafka. This test uses `EmbeddedKafka`.
You can also run the application against a real Kafka cluster to see it in action.
